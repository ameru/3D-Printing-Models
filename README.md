# 3D_Printing_Models
I recently just found out my university has a 3D printer and my life has been changed. Here is a list of things I'm planning on printing - try exporting designs to .STL files if you are a MacOS user, but .f3d should work if you open designs through the desktop interface.

## Tech Stack
- Autodesk Fusion for 3D Modeling. You can get a free 3-year educational license here: <https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial>
- MakerBot for scaling, previewing, and shipping product out to print. You can download either MakerBot Print or MakerBot Desktop - I chose MakerBot Desktop: <https://support.makerbot.com/troubleshooting/makerbot-desktop-software/software-download/download_12190>
- MakerBot Replicator Z18 3D Printer for the actual printing. You can buy one here if you have $5.5k to drop: <https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1039972-REG/makerbot_mp05950_replicator_z18_3d_printer.html/?ap=y&ap=y&smp=y&smp=y&lsft=BI%3A514&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7IKhltSC6AIVchitBh0LcwZ4EAQYCCABEgJigPD_BwE>

## Items queued for printing:
- A motor operated fan. I printed the blades with MakerBot, but saudered the wires and fused them with the switch using pliers and a tiny blowtorch.
- A Stanford logo keychain for my best frienddd
- A Supreme and Gucci logo keychain because people be cloutchasers and hypebeasts
- BABY YODA FIGURINE (done, but file exceeded 25MB so unfortunately could not upload)
- Lamborghini Egoista Model because it looks absolutely DOPE
